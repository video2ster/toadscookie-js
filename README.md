# Toad's Cookie
An extremely basic retro game engine written in JavaScript.

## What it can do
* Render and scale images

## What I'd like it to do
In order of importance:
* Track sprites on screen (as classes)
* Apply simple render effects
* Have console-like functions (resetting, forced crashing, cartridge tilting, save batteries, and cold-resets)
* Add simple networking

## Why you'd use it
It can create retro-styled games that run right in your browser! It tries to be standards compliant and uses lots
of classes, it can be styled with CSS since it's just an HTML5 canvas, and it seems to work pretty quickly.

## Licensing
It's licensed under the MIT license because I genuinely do not care how it's used and I don't plan to make any
money off of it. It's a dead simple game engine and I want it to be available to everyone.
